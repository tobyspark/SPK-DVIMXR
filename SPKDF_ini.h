### KEYS
#
# Name = What is shown in menu
# MinY...MaxV = As per TVOne keyer settings. 
# Note these are super sensitive, one laptop will have slightly different numbers to another to acheive otherwise the same -- ie. pure blue -- key.
 
[Key1]
Name = Lumakey
MinY = 0
MaxY = 18
MinU = 128
MaxU = 129
MinV = 128
MaxV = 129

[Key2]
Name = Chromakey
MinY = 30
MaxY = 35
MinU = 237
MaxU = 242
MinV = 114
MaxV = 121

# Edit the above, or add your own keys here, up to Key99

###Â RESOLUTIONS
#
# Name = What is shown in menu
# Number = Resolution number in TVOne. ie. what would be set in Menu > Outputs > Set Resolution
# EDID Number = The EDID to use on the inputs, which what your computer will think its connected to. ie. what would be set in Menu > Windows > Display Emul. EDID
#
# EDID numbers are as follows
# 0 = Mem1, 1 = Mem2, 2 = Mem3, 
# 3 = Mem4 which we use for Matrox EDID, its uploaded by the controller as part of 'Conform Processor'
# 4 = 3D, 5 = HDMI, 6 = DVI, 7 = Monitor Passthrough
